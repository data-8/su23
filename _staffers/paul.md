bio: Hi there - I’m Paul and I’m a transfer student majoring in Applied Math. I like playing Pokémon, listening to Spanish music, and learning about science-based tools for everyday life. Summer is here which means more sunny skies and more opportunities to get that morning sunlight to help maintain a healthy circadian rhythm! ☀️
