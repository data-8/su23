bio: I am currently a ML research scientist at Apple where I focus on multimodal/vision models and interpretability. Before that, I did both my undergraduate (2021) and Master's in CS at UC Berkeley (2022). I am excited to be part of this course again for a 10th term, and share the beauty of Data 8, a course that was the beginning of my programming journey during undergrad.
